# Hello World Program

## Overview

As an aspiring software engineer, I'm building a foundation in mobile application development to expand my technical skills and create meaningful user experiences. This Hello World program represents the beginning of my journey into cross-platform mobile development using modern JavaScript technologies.

This software demonstrates a classic "Hello World" implementation with personalized features including dynamic date/time display, program execution information, and a professional presentation format. The program serves as a stepping stone toward building more complex mobile applications using React Native framework.

My purpose for creating this software is to establish a solid foundation in JavaScript programming and prepare for developing a comprehensive Habit Tracker & Goal Setter mobile application. This project allows me to practice fundamental programming concepts while setting up the development environment needed for future mobile app projects.

## Running the Program
1. Open terminal/command prompt
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   node hello-world.js
   ```

## Development Environment

I developed this software using Visual Studio Code as my primary integrated development environment, which provides excellent JavaScript syntax highlighting and debugging capabilities. The project utilizes Node.js runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside of a web browser, giving me experience with server-side JavaScript development.

The programming language used is JavaScript (ES6+), which is essential for modern web and mobile development. JavaScript's versatility makes it perfect for both web applications and mobile app development through frameworks like React Native, which I plan to use for my upcoming mobile application projects.
